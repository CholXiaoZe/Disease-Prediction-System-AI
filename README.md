## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a web-based disease prediction and appointment platform to improve medical accessibility. In modern society, many people lack easy access to professional medical advice, leading to late discovery of health issues. Our system helps users understand their health conditions through an AI-assisted concept and encourages early consultation.

## 2. Key Features
* **AI-Assisted Consultation Concept:** Provides basic medical suggestions and answers common health questions as a virtual assistant.
* **Interactive Appointment System:** Users can select medical services and choose available time slots easily.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean design built to simplify the process of finding suitable medical services.
