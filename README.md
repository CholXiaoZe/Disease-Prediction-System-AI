## 2. Key Features
* [cite_start]**AI-Assisted Consultation Concept:** Provides basic medical suggestions and answers common health questions as a virtual assistant[cite: 39, 40].
* [cite_start]**Interactive Appointment System:** Users can select medical services and choose available time slots easily[cite: 37, 38].
* [cite_start]**User-Friendly Interface:** A clean design built to simplify the process of finding suitable medical services[cite: 22, 35].
